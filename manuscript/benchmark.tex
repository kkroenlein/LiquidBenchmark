%\section{Abstract}
\begin{abstract}

Useful atomistic simulations in the condensed phase require accurate depictions of solvent.  
While experimental measurements of fundamental physical properties offer a straightforward approach for evaluating forcefield quality, the bulk of this information has been tied up in non-machine-readable formats.
This inaccessibility hinders reproducible benchmarks of forcefield accuracy.
Here we examine the feasibility of benchmarking atomistic forcefields against the NIST ThermoML database of physicochemical measurements, which aggregates thousands of experimental measurements in a portable, machine-readable, and self-annotating format. 
We present a detailed benchmark of the generalized Amber small molecule forcefield (GAFF) using the AM1-BCC charge model against measurements (specifically liquid densities and static dielectric constants at ambient pressure) extracted from ThermoML, and discuss the extent of available data for neat liquids.  
{\color{red} We show that empirical polarizability models correct systematic biases inherent in predicting dielectric constants with fixed-charged forcefields.  [JDC: Will need to be convinced!]}

\section{Introduction}

Recent advances in hardware and molecular dynamics software have provided routine access to atomistic simulations at the 100 ns timescale and beyond. 
Leveraging these advances in combination with GPU clusters, distributed computing, or custom hardware has brought the microsecond and milliseconds within reach.  
These dramatic advances in sampling, however, have revealed forcefields as a critical barrier for truly predictive simulation.  

Protein and water forcefields have been the subject of numerous benchmarks~\cite{lindorff2012systematic} and enhancements~\cite{li2011iterative, best2012optimization, Lindorff-Larsen2010}, with key outcomes including the ability to fold fast-folding proteins, improved fidelity of water thermodynamic properties, and improved prediction of NMR observables.  
Although small molecule forcefields have also been the subject of benchmarks~\cite{caleman2011force} and improvements~\cite{fennell2014fixed}, such work has typically focused on small perturbations to specific functional groups.  
For example, a recent study found that modified hydroxyl nonbonded parameters led to improved prediction of static dielectrics and hydration free energies \cite{fennell2014fixed}.
There are also outstanding questions of generalizability of parameters.  
Will changes to a specific chemical moiety be compatible with seemingly unrelated improvements?  
Addressing these questions requires agreement on shared benchmarks that can be easily replicated with proposed forcefield enhancements.

A key barrier in forcefield development is that many experimental datasets are heterogeneous, paywalled, and unavailable in machine-readable formats (although notable counterexamples exist, e.g. RCSB~\cite{Berman2000}, FreeSolv~\cite{freesolv} and BMRB~\cite{Ulrich2008}).  
While this inconvenience is relatively minor for benchmarking a single target (e.g. water), it becomes prohibitive for studies spanning chemical space.  
To ameliorate problems of data archival, the NIST Thermodynamics Research Center has developed a IUPAC standard XML-based format---ThermoML \cite{frenkel2006xml}---for storing physicochemical measurements, uncertainties, and metadata.
 Experimental researchers publishing measurements in several journals (J.~Chem.~Eng.~Data, J.~Chem.~Therm., Fluid Phase Equil., Therm.~Acta, and Int.~J.~Therm.) are now guided through a data archival process that involves sanity checks and archival at the TRC (\url{http://trc.nist.gov/ThermoML.html}).  

Here we examine the ThermoML archive as a potential source for neat liquid density and static dielectric constant measurements, with the goal of developing a standard benchmark for validating these properties in fixed-charge forcefields of drug-like molecules.  
These two observables provide sensitive tests of forcefield accuracy that are nonetheless straightforward to calculate.  
Using the ThermoML data, we evaluate the generalized Amber small molecule forcefield (GAFF)~\cite{gaff} with the AM1-BCC charge model~\cite{am1bcc1,am1bcc2} and identify systematic biases that might be improved upon.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Neat Liquid Measurements in ThermoML}

We performed a number of sequential queries to summarize the ThermoML content relevant for benchmarking organic molecule forcefields.  
Our aim is to explore neat liquid data with functional groups relevant to drug-like molecules.  
We therefore applied the following sequence of filters: has either density or static dielectric measurements, contains a single component, contains only druglike elements (H, N, C, O, S, P, F, Cl, Br), has low heavy atom count $(\le 10)$, has ambient temperature [K] $(270 \le T \le 330)$, has ambient pressure [kPA] $(100 \le P \le 102)$, and has density greater than 300 kg $m^{-3}$ (a proxy for liquid state).  
After applying these filters, we also round all pressures within this range to exactly one atmosphere.  We also round temperatures to one decimal place.  
These approximations are motived by common data entry errors; for example, an experiment performed at water's freezing point at ambient pressure might be entered as either 101.325 kPA or 100 kPA, with a temperature of either 273 K or 273.15 K.  
The application of these filters (Table \ref{table:ThermoMLSummary}) leaves 245 conditions for which both density and dielectric data are available.  
The functional groups present are summarized in Table \ref{table:FunctionalGroups}.

\subsection{Benchmarking GAFF against ThermoML: Mass Density}

Mass density has been widely used for parameterizing and testing forcefields, particularly the Lennard Jones parameters \cite{jorgensen1983comparison, jorgensen1984optimized}.  
We therefore used the present ThermoML compilation as a benchmark of the GAFF / AM1-BCC forcefield (Fig. \ref{figure:Density}).  
Overall, the densities show reasonable accuracy (RMS percent error: 3 \% $\pm$ 0.1\%), consistent with previous studies \cite{caleman2011force} reporting agreement of 4 \% on a different benchmark set.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Benchmarking GAFF / AM1-BCC against ThermoML: Static Dielectric}

As a measure of the electronic medium, the static dielectric constant of neat liquids provides a critical benchmark of electrostatic models.  
We therefore compare simulations against the measurements in our ThermoML compilation.  
Overall, we find the dielectric constants to be qualitatively reasonable, but with clear deviations from experiment.  
In particular, GAFF / AM1-BCC systematically underestimates the dielectric constants for nonpolar organics, with the predictions of $\epsilon \approx 1.0 \pm 0.05$ being substantially smaller than the measured $\epsilon \approx 2$.  
Because this deviation likely stems from the lack of electronic polarization, we added a simple empirical correction for polarization \cite{bosque2002polarizabilities} that is based on counting the elements in a molecule:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sales}
\begin{split}
\frac{\alpha}{\textnormal{\AA}} = 1.53 n_C + 0.17 n_H + 0.57 n_O + 1.05 n_N + 2.99 n_S + \\ 2.48 n_P + 0.22 n_F + 2.16 n_{Cl} + 3.29 n_{Br} + 5.45 n_I + 0.32 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
From the polarizability, one can correct the static dielectric using the following equation (from ref. \cite{horn2004}):
$$\epsilon_{corrected} = \epsilon_{MD} + 4 \pi N  \frac{\alpha}{\langle V \rangle}$$
A similar polarization correction was used in the development of the TIP4P-EW water model \cite{horn2004}; however, the need is much greater for the nonpolar organics, as the missing polarizability is the dominant contribution to the static dielectric constant.  
In the case of water, the Sales polarizability model predicts a dielectric correction of 0.52, while 0.79 was used for the TIP4P-EW model.  
For comparison, we also applied the same empirical correction to the VirtualChemistry dataset \cite{caleman2011force, van2012gromacs} and saw similarly improved agreement with experiment for both the GAFF and OPLS forcefields (Fig. \ref{figure:VirtualChemistry}).

Simulation error bars represent one standard error of the mean estimated via block averaging with block sizes of 200 ps \cite{flyvbjerg1989error}.  
Experimental error bars indicate the larger of standard deviation between independently reported measurements and the authors reported standard deviations; for some measurements, neither uncertainty estimate is available.  
See section \ref{section:experimental-error} for further discussion of error.  
The inverse dielectric $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ is plotted instead of $\epsilon$ because $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ is directly proportional to energy in continuum dielectric models: e.g. $U(r) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} \propto \frac{1}{\epsilon}$.

% FITTING FORCEFIELDS TO DIELECTRIC CONSTANTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Fitting Forcefields to Dielectric Constants}

Recent forcefield development has seen a resurgence of papers fitting dielectric constants as primary data \cite{wang2014building, fennell2014fixed}.  
However, a number of authors have pointed out potential challenges in constructing self-consistent fixed-charge forcefields \cite{fennell2012simple, leontyev2014polarizable}.  


Interestingly, a recent work by Dill \cite{fennell2012simple} pointed out that, for $\mathrm{CCl_4}$, reasonable choices of point charges are incapable of recapitulating the observed dielectric of $\epsilon = 2.2$, instead producing dielectric constants in the range of $1.0 \le \epsilon \le 1.05$.  
This behavior is quite general: a fixed charge monopole force field predicts $\epsilon \approx 1$ for several nonpolar or symmetric molecules, but the measured dielectric constants are instead $\epsilon \approx 2$ (Fig. \ref{figure:nonpolars}).  
While this behavior is well-known and results from missing physics of polarizability, we suspect it may have several unanticipated consequences.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

}
\label{figure:nonpolars}

\end{figure}


Suppose, for example, that one attempts to fit forcefield parameters to match the static dielectric constants of $\mathrm{CCl_4}$, $\mathrm{CHCl_3}$, $\mathrm{CH_2Cl_2}$, and $\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$.
In moving from the tetrahedrally-symmetric $\mathrm{CCl_4}$ to $\mathrm{CHCl_3}$, it suddenly becomes possible to achieve the observed dielectric constant of 4.8 by an appropriate choice of point charges.
However, the model for $\mathrm{CHCl_3}$ uses fixed point charges to account for \emph{both} the permanent dipole moment and the electronic polarizability, whereas the $\mathrm{CCl_4}$ model contains no treatment of polarizability.  
We hypothesize that this inconsistency in parameterization may lead to strange mismatches, where symmetric molecules (e.g. benzene, $\mathrm{CCl_4}$) have qualitatively different properties than closely related asymmetric molecules (e.g. toluene, $\mathrm{CHCl_3}$).

As a possible real-world example, we imagine that the missing polarizability could be important in accurate transfer free energies involving low-dielectric solvents.  
Using the Onsager model for the transfer free energy of a dipole (Eqn. \ref{eq:onsager}) gives an error of $\Delta \Delta G = \Delta G(\epsilon=2.2) - \Delta G(\epsilon=1)$ of 2 kcal / mol for the transfer of water ($a = 1.93$ \AA\, $\mu = 2.2$D) into a low dielectric medium such as tetrachloromethane or benzene.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:onsager}
\Delta G = -\frac{\mu^2}{a^3}\frac{\epsilon - 1}{2 \epsilon + 1}
\end{equation}

Given their ease of measurement and direct connection to long-range electrostatic interactions, static dielectric constants should be considered primary data for forcefield parameterization efforts.  Although this will require the use of forcefields with explicit polarizability, the inconsistency of fixed-charge models in low-dielectric media is sufficiently alarming to motivate further study of polarizable forcefields.  In particular, continuum methods \cite{truchon2010using, truchon2009integrated, truchon2008accurate}, induced dipole methods \cite{Ponder2010, ren2004temperature}, and drude methods \cite{lamoureux2003modeling, anisimov2005determination} have been maturing rapidly.  Finding the optimal balance of accuracy and performance remains an open question; however, the use of experimentally-parameterized direct polarization methods \cite{wang2013systematic} may provide polarizability physics at a cost not much greater than fixed charge forcefields.


\subsection{ThermoML as a Data Source}

The present work has focused on the neat liquid density and dielectric measurements present in ThermoML \cite{frenkel2006xml, frenkel2003thermoml, chirico2003thermoml} as a target for molecular dynamics forcefield validation.  
While densities and dielectric constants have been widely used in forcefield work, several aspects of ThermoML make it a unique resource for the forcefield community.  
First, the aggregation, support, and dissemination of ThermoML is supported by NIST, whose mission makes these tasks a long-term priority.  
Second, ThermoML is actively growing, through partnerships with several journals---new experimental measurements published in these journals are critically examined by the TRC and included in the archive.  
Finally, the files in ThermoML are machine readable via a formal XML schema, allowing facile access to thousands of measurements.  
In the future, we hope to examine additional measurement classes, including both mixture and two-phase data.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% METHODS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Methods}

\subsection{ThermoML Processing}

ThermoML XML files were obtained from the the NIST TRC.  To explore their content, we created a python (version 2.7.9) tool (ThermoPyl: \url{https://github.com/choderalab/ThermoPyL}) that munges the XML content into a spreadsheet-like format accessible via the  Pandas (version 0.15.2) library.  
First, we obtained the XML schema (\url{http://media.iupac.org/namespaces/ThermoML/ThermoML.xsd}) defining the layout of the data.  
This schema was converted into a Python object via PyXB 1.2.4 (\url{http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/}).  
Finally, this schema and Pandas was used to extract the data and apply the data filters described above.  

\subsection{Simulation}
Boxes of 1000 molecules were constructed using PackMol \cite{martinez2009packmol}. 
AM1-BCC~\cite{am1bcc1,am1bcc2} charges were generated using OpenEye Toolkit 2014-6-6 \cite{openeye}, using the {\tt oequacpac.OEAssignPartialCharges} module with the {\tt OECharges\_AM1BCCSym}.  
The selected conformer was then processed using antechamber in AmberTools~14~\cite{amber14}.  
The resulting AMBER files were converted to OpenMM~\cite{eastman2012openmm} ffxml forcefield XML files.  
Simulation code used libraries gaff2xml~0.6, TrustButVerify~0.1, OpenMM~6.2~\cite{eastman2012openmm}, and MDTraj~1.2~\cite{mcgibbon2014mdtraj}.  
{\color{red}[TODO: Provide a script to install all of these versions via {\tt conda}.]}

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using OpenMM~6.2~\cite{eastman2012openmm} using a Langevin integrator (with collision rate 1 ps$^{-1}$) and a 1~fs timestep; interestingly, we found that a 2~fs timestep led to insufficient accuracy in equilibrium densities (Table~\ref{table:TimestepDependence}).  
{\color{red}[JDC: Cite Langevin integrator used in OpenMM.]}
Pressure coupling at 1 atmosphere was achieved with a Monte Carlo barostat utilizing molecular scaling and automated step size adjustment during equilibration, applied every 25 steps.  
Particle mesh Ewald~\cite{Darden1993} was used with a long-range cutoff of 0.95~nm and an long-range isotropic dispersion correction.  
{\color{red}[JDC: Can we report the automatically-selected PME parameters?]}
Simulations were continued until density standard errors were less than $2 \times 10^{-4}$ g / mL, as estimated using the equilibration detection module in pymbar 2.1~\cite{shirts2008statistically}.  
Trajectory analysis was performed using OpenMM~\cite{eastman2012openmm} and MDTraj~\cite{mcgibbon2014mdtraj}.  
Density data was output every 250~fs, while trajectory data was stored every 10~ps.

\caption{To probe the systematic error from finite time-step integration, we examined the timestep dependence of butyl acrylate density.  
The number of effective samples was estimated using pymbar's statistical inefficiency routine \cite{shirts2008statistically}.  
To approximate the timestep bias, we compare the density expectation ($\langle \rho \rangle$) to values calculated with a 0.5fs timestep.  
We find a 2fs timestep leads to systematic biases in the density on the order of 0.2\%, while 1fs reduces the systematic bias to less than 0.1\%---we therefore selected a 1fs timestep for the present work, where we aimed to achieve three digits of accuracy in density predictions.

\caption{{\bf Assessment of experimental error in ThermoML data.}
To assess the experimental error in our benchmark set, we consider two orthogonal error measurements.  
The first is the mean of the uncertainties reported by the measurement authors.  
The second is the standard deviation of measurements in ThermoML.   
We see that author-reported uncertainties appear to be overly optimistic for densities (a, c), but author-reported uncertainties of dielectrics (b, d) appear consistent with the standard deviations.  
A simple psychological explanation might be that because density measurements are more routine, the authors simply report the accuracy limit of their hardware (e.g. 0.0001 g / mL for a Mettler Toledo DM40 \cite{mettlertoledo}).  
However, this hardware limit is not achieved due to inconsistencies in sample preparation; see Appendix in Ref.~\cite{chirico2013improvement}.  
Note that in panels (c, d) show the same information as (a, b) but as a function of the measurement index, rather than as a scatter plot---because not all measurements have author-supplied uncertainties, panels (c, d) contains slightly more data points than (a, b).

%\subsection{Dielectric Uncertainty}
%Following the discussion in \cite{horn2004}, we note that the static dielectric can be expressed as 

%$$\epsilon_0 = 1 + \frac{4\pi}{3k_B} \frac{\langle (M - \langle M\rangle)^2\rangle}{\langle V \rangle \langle T \rangle}$$

%We note that the dipole moment can be separated into vector components and expanded to give

%$$\epsilon_0 = 1 + \frac{4\pi}{3k_B} \frac{\langle M_x^2 \rangle + \langle M_y^2 \rangle + \langle M_z^2 \rangle - \langle M_x \rangle^2 - \langle M_y \rangle^2 - \langle M_z \rangle^2}{\langle V \rangle \langle T \rangle}$$

%We approximate the uncertainty using error propagation, e.g. $\delta(f)^2 \approx \sum_i (\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i})^2 \delta(x_i)^2$

%$$\delta(\epsilon_0)^2 = \frac{4\pi}{3k_B}[(\frac{M}{T V^2})^2 \delta(V)^2 + (\frac{M}{T^2 V})^2 \delta(T)^2 + (\frac{1}{T V})^2 \delta(M)^2]$$

%$$ = \frac{4\pi}{3k_B}(\frac{M}{TV})^2[(\frac{\delta(V)^2}{V^2} + \frac{\delta(T)^2}{T^2} + \frac{\delta(M)^2}{M^2}]$$

%$$\delta(M)^2 = \delta(\langle M_x^2 \rangle)^2 + \delta(\langle M_y^2 \rangle)^2 + \delta(\langle M_z^2 \rangle)^2 + \delta(\langle M_x \rangle)^2 + \delta(\langle M_y \rangle)^2 + \delta(\langle M_z \rangle)^2 $$
